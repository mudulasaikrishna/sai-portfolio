            <h4>
                Hello! I’m Sai Krishna, a student of ICFAI University with a passion for front-end development and a creative mind for building visually appealing and user-friendly websites. My goal is to become a skilled Front-End Developer, and I’ve been putting in the effort to refine my skills by working on various exciting projects.
                I believe that every great website tells a story and provides a seamless experience to its users. My journey as a developer has been driven by a desire to create designs that not only look great but also function effectively. Here's a quick look at some of the projects I’ve worked on:
