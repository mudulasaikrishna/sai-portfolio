            My name is Mudula sai krishna. I am studying computer science & engineering at ICFAI UNIVERSITY.
            In order to kick start my career before i graduate, i am looking for an Internship/Job of a front-end developer
            since that's what i've been doing already for year in my free time. Designing websites for friends, Developing 
            simple E-shops with the help of some open source content-management system, and so on. Besides that i am a normal guy
            who enjoys spending time with friends, while not working or studying, which takes most of my time of course, If i 
            should pick the best website i've designed up to this point it will be this portfolio, Netflix clone, Amazon clone,
            currency converter, and still some websites are under developing stage. I am genuine and hard-working and i believe your
            will give me a chance to prove my words.
