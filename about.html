                <h3>My Journey as a Developer</h3>
                <p>My journey in web development began during my college years when I started experimenting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build small projects. Over time, I refined my skills, added React to my toolkit, and began creating full-fledged web applications. These experiences not only helped me understand the technical side of development but also taught me how to think creatively, solve problems, and pay attention to the smallest of details.<br>
                    One of my proudest milestones was when I successfully completed my first client project, LoanAxix. This loan services website wasn’t just a project; it was a turning point in my career. It helped me gain real-world experience, interact with clients, and understand the importance of delivering a product that meets user needs. It also marked a special moment in my life as it earned me my first income, validating all the hard work I had put into learning and growing as a developer.
